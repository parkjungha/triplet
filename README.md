# Towards Solving Inefficiency of Self-supervised Representation Learning


This is the code of our paper "Towards Solving Inefficiency of Self-supervised Representation Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08760).

See median_triplet_head.py for the median triplet loss. More updates are coming soon.


## ImageNet

## COCO 2017

## PASCAL VOC

## SYSU-30k


We next verify the effectiveness of our method on a more extensive data set, [SYSU-30k](https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k), that is 30 times larger than ImageNet both in terms of category number and image number.




This repo has been tested in the following environment.

Pytorch1.9
